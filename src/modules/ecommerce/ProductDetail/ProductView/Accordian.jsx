          <b>Delivery address - commercial or residential?</b>D If the delivery address
          is <b>residential</b>, would you be open to arranging a pickup from a <b>nearby
          commercial address?</b>  A Budget Truck Tires representative will get in
          touch with you to discuss and agree on a convenient location, thus
          avoiding any additional surcharges imposed by freight companies for
          residential deliveries. <br />
          <b>Can you ship to a residential address?</b> Yes, we
          can. However, most LTL carriers will <b>upcharge at least $135</b>  and they
          will group all residential deliveries instead of shipping the next
          business day. This will <b>delay</b>  the delivery <b>for at least 1-2 business
          days</b> and generate additional delivery costs.
          
          <br /> <b>What are your shipping
          methods and how long do they take? </b> <br />
          – Some tires will be shipped via
          FedEx or UPS Ground. The majority of the tires we sell will be shipped
          via LTL due to their size and weight. <br /> – If shipped via ground service,
          you should receive your order within 2-3 business days after the order
          has been picked up by the carrier. <br /> – If shipped via LTL, you should
          receive your order within 3-5 business days after the order has been
          picked up by the carrier.

          our locations. The warehouses <b>do not</b>  handle any payment.
